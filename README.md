# Problem Solving in C

![Demo](https://www.cdslab.org/recipes/images/C.png)

Welcome to the Problem Solving in C repository! This repository contains various C programs that I have written to enhance my problem-solving skills. Each program is a solution to a specific problem, with the problem statement mentioned in the comments at the beginning of each file.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains different types of questions, and each question is accompanied by its solution in C. The problem statements are included in the code as comments before the actual implementation starts.

## How to Compile and Run the Code

To compile and run the C programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/problem_solving-C.git
    cd problem_solving-C
    ```

2. **Compile the Code**: Navigate to the directory containing the C program you want to compile and use the `gcc` compiler to compile the code. For example, if the program file is named `example.c`, you can compile it using:

    ```bash
    gcc -o example example.c
    ```

    This command compiles `example.c` and creates an executable file named `example`.

3. **Run the Program**: Once the code is compiled, you can run the executable file using:

    ```bash
    ./example
    ```

    Replace `example` with the name of the compiled executable file.

## Example

Here is an example of how to compile and run a program:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the C file
cd some_directory

# Compile the program
gcc -o program_name program_name.c

# Run the program
./program_name
```
